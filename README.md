# github_auto
Basic Bash script to automatize github configuration when i need to config a new vm/pc, 

The script will:

- Ask for your GitHub username and email
- Ask if you want to generate an SSH key
- Display your public key so you can add it to your GitHub account
- 
you only need to copy this on your pc
transform in a exec with "chmod +x ./github_auto.sh"
run with "./github_auto.sh"

Yeaaaaa ;P
